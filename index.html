        <div class="space-y-6 text-lg">
            <p>
                Space Waves stands at the forefront of modern arcade gaming, offering an exhilarating side-scrolling adventure that masterfully combines fast-paced action with strategic challenges. Released in April 2024 by do.games, Space Waves has quickly established itself as a compelling addition to the arcade game genre, capturing the attention of players worldwide with its unique blend of classic gameplay mechanics and modern design elements.
            </p>

            <p>
                At its core, Space Waves challenges players to navigate through intricately designed space tunnels, where split-second decisions determine survival. The game's innovative control system, utilizing either mouse, spacebar, or touch screen inputs, provides precise control over your spacecraft, making every movement crucial in the vast expanse of space. This accessibility in controls makes Space Waves appealing to both casual players and hardcore gaming enthusiasts.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the most distinctive features of Space Waves is its comprehensive level structure, featuring 33 meticulously crafted levels. Each level in Space Waves is thoughtfully categorized using emoji indicators, providing players with clear difficulty expectations. The "Green" levels offer more generous spacing and manageable angles, perfect for mastering the fundamental mechanics of arrow speed control and spatial awareness.
            </p>

            <p>
                The combat system in Space Waves adds another layer of complexity to the gameplay. Players must balance their focus between navigation and combat, as enemy spaceships regularly appear, firing projectiles that must be avoided or countered. Successfully destroying these hostile vessels not only awards points but also potentially drops power-ups, creating a risk-reward dynamic that keeps players engaged throughout their journey.
            </p>

            <p>
                Space Waves features two distinct game modes that cater to different playstyles. The World 1 mode serves as an excellent entry point, offering a more structured and gradual difficulty progression that helps new players acclimate to the game's mechanics. In contrast, the Endless mode in Space Waves presents an infinite challenge, where players must rely on their reflexes and growing expertise to achieve ever-higher scores in procedurally generated tunnels.
            </p>

            <p>
                The power-up system in Space Waves adds strategic depth to the gameplay. Players can enhance their spacecraft's capabilities through various power-ups, including increased firepower for more effective enemy elimination, temporary invulnerability for navigating particularly challenging sections, and time dilation effects that provide crucial moments of relief during intense sequences.
            </p>

            <p>
                What truly sets Space Waves apart is its endlessly generated space tunnels, ensuring that no two playthroughs are exactly alike. This procedural generation system keeps the experience fresh and challenging, as players must constantly adapt to new obstacle configurations and enemy patterns. The game's difficulty scaling ensures that as players progress, the challenges evolve to match their growing skill level.
            </p>

            <p>
                The visual design of Space Waves creates an immersive space atmosphere, with dynamic lighting effects and smooth animations that enhance the gaming experience without compromising performance. The game's optimized performance ensures that players can focus entirely on the challenging gameplay without technical distractions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Whether you're a newcomer to arcade games or a seasoned player seeking a new challenge, Space Waves offers an engaging experience that rewards dedication and skill improvement. The game's precise control system, combined with its variety of challenges and power-ups, creates an addictive gameplay loop that keeps players coming back for more.
